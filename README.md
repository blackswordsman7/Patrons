## General info

The patrons can show their love for the open source projects by sharing the interest generated by Aave's lending protocol.
It leverages the interest bearing feature of aTokens, and wide variety of underlying assets in the Aave protocol which provides
flexibility and encourages a larger audience to become one of us.
